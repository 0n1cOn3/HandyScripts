#### *Import This Command*

To import this command into your JumpCloud tenant run the below command using the [JumpCloud PowerShell Module](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support/wiki/Installing-the-JumpCloud-PowerShell-Module)

```
Import-JCCommand -URL 'https://git.io/jccg-Mac-SetDesktopBackground'
```

#### **Troubleshooting Tips**

Check to see if the file is downloading on the machine by navigating to /Users/Shared 
If the image file is not downloading to the machine it is likley that the 'fileType' has not been updated to match the file (png/jpg)

If the file is downloaded the issue is likley the 'RUN AS' user has not been specificed. If the command is run as 'root' the file will download but not the background will not be applied. 'RUN AS' must be set to run as the user whose desktop image you wish to set.
